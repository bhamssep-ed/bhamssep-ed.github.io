Telescope: The University of Birmingham Observatory

 The University of Birmingham's own observatory was established in 1982 as a
 teaching laboratory for undergraduate students in physics and astronomy. 
 Today, students use the observatory as part of several laboratory courses in 
 the undergraduate degree programme.

 Situated in Kings Norton, just 8 km away from the University campus, the
 observatory is easily accessible. As a result, the University also hosts <i>
     Astronomy in the City </i> several times throughout the year, where the
 public (yes, <i> you </i>) can join us for stargazing, listen to talks from our
 expert astronomers, and ask any question you ever wondered about astronomy.

Note that
 objects in the Infrared wavelengths will not be visible from here. Radio
 wavelengths on the other hand are not affected at all from cloudy weather,
but the observatory does not have a radio telescope on site. 
 There is a single telescope with a 50-cm diameter
 mirror, and the primary instrument is an imaging camera that can take 
 pictures in broadband <i> optical </i> light, or using the B, V, R, I filters. 

Unfortunately, the UK is not known to be have the best weather, 
 so you might have to wait for a couple of weeks to get your observation. 
Despite the avert weather
 conditions, small observatories such as this one make regularly contributions to astronomical
 research. An example is the discovery of a bright Supernova in the nearby
 galaxy M82 by students observing at the London Observatory in 2014.

 <!-- Telescope: Birmingham Observatory 
 
 Just a stone's throw away from our homes this
 observatory is the easiest to reach. A lovely telescope allows you to observe
 your targets. Unfortunately, the UK is not known to be have the best weather.
 You might need to wait for a couple of weeks to get your observation. Note that
 objects in the Infrared wavelengths will be invisible from here. Radio
 wavelengths on the other hand are not affected at all from cloudy weather. 
 
 The
 Birmingham university is operating a little observatory in the south of the
 City of Birmingham (see picture). Despite the Weather it is regularly used for
 the education of students as well as for outreach. Such little observatories
 can be found in many cities in the UK. And despite the avert weather
 conditions, these observatories make regularly contributions to astronomical
 research. An example is the discovery of a bright Supernova in the nearby
 galaxy M82 by students observing at the London Observatory in 2014. -->

  Telescope: VLT telescope 

The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is actually four separate telescopes, each with a
8.4-m mirror. The telescopes are located in the Atacama Desert in northern
Chile, South America. The Atacama Desert is one of the driest places in
the world, and as such is home to many astronomical observatories, visual and
radio alike. 

The observatory is located on a mountain peak, 2600 m above sea level. 
Due to its position on top of a high mountain range, just close to the pacific
coast, almost every night is clear at this place. The humidity is low allowing
observations in almost all wavelength ranges, except those that are only
accessible from space. Thanks to the excellent infrastructure in Chile, going
there is nowadays only a matter of one or two days, which allows astronomers to
travel from the UK to the observatory and observe their targets. In fact, the
ESO Paranal Observatory (which host the VLT telescopes ,see picture) is one of
the largest observatories in the world with about one hundred technicians and
scientists being on site every day.

Telescope: ASTEP telescope â€“ ask George for nice picture  

This place is known to be the most remote place on Earth. With average
temperatures around -50degree C it is also not the first place you would think
of when going for stargazing. Nevertheless, it has a few advantages for
astronomers and for you, if you like to observe your target from there.  

First, for half the year, there is continuous night at the South Pole. Second, there
are spaces, so-called domes, that are practically cloud free. Third, it is one
of the driest places on Earth. Almost any wavelength range can be observed from
here, except of them that are only accessible from space.  Any observatory in
this place is the closest thing, you can get on Earth, to an actual space
telescope. Robotic telescopes like ASTEP (see picture) observing the sky from
here.
